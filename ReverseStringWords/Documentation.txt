Reverse every word in a message:

input:string pangram = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

-Write the code necessary to reverse the letters of each word in place and display the result

output:ehT kciuq nworb xof spmuj revo eht yzal god

Solution:
1.Create a string array message that takes every word in pangram
-to do that i use Split(' '),that way every element in message will
be a word from pangram

2.Create a new string arrat newMessage that stores a reversed copy
of the words from message

3.Loop throug each element in the message array, then we reverse it and
is stored in newMessage array

4.Use Join(" ", newMessage), to create a new string array that has the elements
from newMessage but separated by a space, to generate the final output
